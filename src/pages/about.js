    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      We want to help train, equip, and resource the next generation of
      believers in all forms of creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to see the local family and church become the cultivator of all
      culture once again in the arts/media, governance, education, the home, the
      church, and business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to share your god-glorifying work that is done locally with those
      in the global body of christ.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      By you simply creating a free profile, we can connect you to a host of
      creatives in godâ€™s global family, who are excellent in christlikeness,
      character, and craft. And, more specifically, if you have a talent, a
      skill, a project, or work you'd like to promote, contribute, or share with
      the community in order to make it available to the body of christ, you
      can!
    </p>
    <p>Let the fun networking possibilities begin.</p>
